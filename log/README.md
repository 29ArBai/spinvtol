### Data Formatting
For run?.txt files, each entry is formatted as: time,x,y,z,rx,ry,rz,throttle,flap
For richrun?.txt files, each entry is formatted as: time,x,y,z,rx,ry,rz,throttle(PWM),flap(PWM),voltage(volt),isAutomaticControl(for future compatibility, 1 if using command over telemetry, 0 if using command from RC transmitter)
